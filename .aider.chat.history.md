```
A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files will need to be edited or added to implement the quiz, update the metadata, and generate the required images:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to import and render the quiz component.  
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to change the app title and description.  
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the app logo.  
4. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – image for the cat result.  
5. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – image for the dog result.  
6. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – image for the fox result.  
7. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – image for the hamster result.  
8. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – image for the horse result.  
9. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that implements the quiz logic and result display.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

I need to add a few new files to implement the quiz and the required images.  
Please add the following files to the chat:

```
mini-app/components/quiz.tsx
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/public/cat.png.todo
mini-app/public/dog.png.todo
mini-app/public/fox.png.todo
mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo
mini-app/public/horse.png.todo
```

Once those files are added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the existing `mini-app/app/page.tsx` and `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`.
